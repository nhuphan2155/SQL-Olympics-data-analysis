# SQL-Olympics-data-analysis

In this SQL project, using the 120 years of Olympics History dataset from Kaggle, I've done an exploratary analysis using basic to advanced SQL queries.

The raw dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/data

I used PostgreSQL, designed schema, created table and imported the CSV files to a SQL Database in my local machine to carry forward with the analysis.

I've used various SQL techniques such as JOIN, WITH...AS, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, DENSE_RANK, COALESCE, CROSSTAB (PIVOT TABLE)
