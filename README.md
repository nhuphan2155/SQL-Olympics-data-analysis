# SQL-Olympics-data-analysis

In this SQL project, using the 120 years of Olympics History dataset from Kaggle, I've done an exploratary analysis using basic to advanced SQL queries.

The raw dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/data

I used PostgreSQL and imported the CSV files to a SQL Database in my local machine to carry forward with the analysis.
